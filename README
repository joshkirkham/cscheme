super janky colorscheme manager for urxvt

Usage: cscheme [COMMANDS] [TARGET]

Commands:

set			Applies the target colorscheme.

list		Lists all available colorschemes.


template	Prints a template colorscheme file to standard output.




======== Installation ==========
Change the variable SCHEMEDIR at the bottom of the cscheme.py file

All scheme files should placed inside a directory named "schemes" inside the 
cschemes directory.

To use the script "colorpicker.sh", you will need to have dmenu installed. It 
needs to run with superuser privelages, thus to run it from an i3 keybinding, you
will need to add a rule to the /etc/sudoers file allowing to run without a 
password.





========== Technical Details =========
The program interfaces with urxvt by sending control sequences to each running 
of a terminal that it detects. The documentation for the structure of these
xterm control sequences is laughably terrible, so here is a reference for future
me to be able to know what the hell is going on inside this code. If you want
to look at this documentation, just google "xterm CSI"


The escape sequences used in this program are formatted like so:

	"\033]NUMBER;#COLOR\007"

where:

	\033	begins the command

	]		specifies that this is an operating system command
	
	NUMBER	A number specifying what is to be modified
			10 or 39	foreground
			11 or 49	background
			4;X			The 16-color code X = a number 0-15
			708			The border color (which is separate from the background)

	;		seperator

	#COLOR	The 6 digit hex colorcode proceeded by a #

	\007	ends the command


The command numbers in this format are barely documented, so if you can't find the
command for the thing you want to do in the relevnat docs, just keep googling. It;is there, it just isn't documented.


For actually sending these commands, the program looks at all running terminal 
instances listed inside the /dev/ptr/ directory. Each one has a number in this dir
